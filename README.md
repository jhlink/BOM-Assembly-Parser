# Project BMP3I
##	Bill of Materials (BOM) and Pick 'N Place Assembly Parser

## Description
	Currently, configuring the PnP machine for a board assembly has a certain number of cumbersome steps. 
This program seeks to eliminate as many of them as possible by automating tedious and time consuming tasks. 

## Goals
1. Parse through the BOM and PnP assembly files.
2. Populate additional data fields with any other required or requested information.
3. Generate the resulting .prg file, which is basically in .csv format with tab delimiters. 

## Notes
	Though the utility of the program is clear, it will be more of an opportunity to exercise certain tools and programming paradigms, namely the following: OOD, Doxygen, and if possible Travis CI testing.
